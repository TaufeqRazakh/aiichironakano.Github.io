<b> Course Description </b><br>

Computer simulation of quantum-mechanical dynamics has become an essential enabling 
technology for physical, chemical and biological sciences and engineering. 
Quantum-dynamics simulations on extreme-scale parallel supercomputers would provide 
unprecedented predictive power, but pose enormous challenges as well. 
This course surveys and projects algorithmic and computing technologies that will make 
quantum-dynamics simulations metascalable, i.e., "design once, continue to scale 
on future computer architectures".
<br><br>
The course first covers how the exponential time complexity for solving 
the quantum N-body problem is reduced to 
(1) O(N<sup>3</sup>) within the density functional theory (DFT), for which Walter Kohn received a Nobel chemistry prize in 1998, and 
(2) O(N) based on physical data-locality principles (e.g., Kohn's quantum nearsightedness principle). 
The course then introduces key abstractions (e.g., pseudopotentials and exchange-correlation functionals) 
and representation issues (e.g., plane-wave basis vs. real-space multigrids), 
which are necessary for efficient implementation of quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) simulations. 
This is followed by the design of QMD simulation algorithms on massively parallel supercomputers 
using message passing and multithreading, including our metascalable divide-conquer-recombine (DCR) algorithmic framework, 
as well as performance optimization on modern many-core processors 
and accelerators through memory hierarchies and vectorization. 
Advanced topics to be covered include 
(1) DCR approaches to excitation dynamics, 
(2) intersection of machine learning and quantum N-body problem, and 
(3) merger of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and QMD methods. 
The course ends with best software practices for co-developing extreme-scale QMD software for million-way parallelism.
<br><br>
Students will learn fundamental knowledge and gain hands-on experience in order to:
(1) reduce the intractable quantum many-body problem to lower-complexity problems, while retaining the essential physics; 
(2) design scalable parallel algorithms for linear-scaling quantum-dynamics simulations; 
(3) develop metascalable quantum-dynamics software on current and future computer architectures.
